# Welcome to Git

## What is git?
Git is a distributed version control. It allows you to work on code with others while keeping your code on you personal machine.

What does git let us do?
  - Revert our code to a workable state in case we break it. (version control)
  - Work on code with others by sharing one repository.
  - Share our code with others who might benefit from it.

How to get started with git:
  - install git
  - create a free github account
  - create your first repository on github.com
  - clone this repository to your computer
