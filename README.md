## Welcome to Git

# What is git?
Git is a distributed version control. It allows you to work on code with others while keeping your code on you personal machine.

What does git let us do?
  - Revert our code to a workable state in case we break it. (version control)
  - Work on code with others by sharing one repository.
  - Share our code with others who might benefit from it.

How to get started with git:
  * install git
  * create a free github account
  * create your first repository on github.com
  * clone this repository to your computer
